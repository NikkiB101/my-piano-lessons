                            syllabus examinations can provide a more structured learning environment however it can be a

                            Many of our adult students choose to learn piano purely for their own enjoyment and do not

                        <p>
                            Getting started with online lessons is really straight forward.
                        </p>

                            You simply need to <a href="https://explore.zoom.us/docs/en-us/freesignup.html"

                                Account.</a> Once your account is created you then let your teacher know the email
                            address you used when setting up your account.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Your child's teacher will call you on Zoom at their lesson time. You can use a mobile,
                            tablet, laptop or computer to take the call. If you have more than one of these options we
                            suggest using the one with the biggest screen.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Online lessons save you time and money with no need to travel. They are also a great way to
                            keep your child engaged in extra curricular activities during the pandemic.
                        </p>
