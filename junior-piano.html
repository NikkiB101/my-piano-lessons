                        <h3>Junior Music</h3>
                        <p>Junior Music is suited to children between the ages of 4 and 11. Our lessons will follow your
                            child's own learning pace to ensure they always find lessons rewarding.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We will ask for a list of your child's favourite songs before they start lessons with us. We
                            then use this list to introduce new concepts. Your child is then motivated to learn each new
                            concept as once they understand the new concept, they are rewarded by being able to play
                            their
                            favourite song.

                        <p>
                            We know that some children like Jazz and others like Rock n Roll, we understand when it
                            comes to
                            Junior Music one size does not fit all. Our teachers are extremely flexible and are happy to
                            discuss your child's learning with you at any stage during their lessons.

                        <p>
                            For many children completing examinations can be a great way to mark the progress they have
                            made identify the standard of playing they have achieved. Formal recognition of their
                            abilities is very beneficial especially if they hope to pursue music in secondary school or college.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        We offer examinations with all exam boards and your child's teacher will discuss the
                        differentoptions open to your child when it comes time for exam preparation. The teacher will
                        review the exam syllabi and suggest which exam board would be most suited to your child however this is
                        only a suggestion. If you want your child to take a particular exam please let your child's
                        teacher know.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Examinations whilst encouraged are not compulsory. If you would prefer that your child does
                            not complete examinations simply let your child's teacher know.
