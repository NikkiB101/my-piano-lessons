                        <p>
                            Teen Piano lessons are designed for 12 to 18 year olds. Whether you are a beginner or a more
                            experienced player we can help you improve your piano skills quickly. Some teenage beginners
                            can progress rapidly if they are willing to put in a little extra progress.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We do not have a fixed syllabi. Each lesson is tailor made for the student so they can
                            progress as quickly as they want. We regularly have students skip exams if their progress is
                            moving so rapidly that examination dates can't keep up.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In our piano lessons, we teach key concepts by allowing the student to learn their favourite
                            songs. This keeps our students motivated and builds their confidence in their playing
                            ability.

                        <p>
                            For many teenagers, examinations are an important part of progression. Many teenage students
                            will be taking music at second level and will be attending lessons to prepare for their
                            practical exam. As the practical exam accounts so many marks, lessons can be an excellent
                            way for teenagers to get a competitive advantage in the CAO system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We offer examinations with all exam boards and your piano teacher will discuss the different
                            options with you during lessons when it comes time for exam preparation. I tis not unusual
                            for our teachers to prepare you for your practical examination a few levels higher than you
                            are currently at.
                            <p>
                                Teachers may indicate that a particular piece at a higher level would suit your playing
                                ability and may be an opportunity for them to receive higher marks. Each teacher
                                understands the importance of preparation for both music exams and state exams and will
                                be completely flexible to meet your requirements.

                        <p>
                            Your child's teacher will call you on Zoom at their lesson time. You can use a mobile,
                            tablet, laptop or computer to take the call. If you have more than one of these options we
                            suggest using the one with the biggest screen.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Online lessons save you time and money with no need to travel. They are also a great way to
                            keep your child engaged in extra curricular activities during the pandemic.
